ADAGE
====================

###Assessment Data Aggregator for Gaming Environments

ADAGE is a set of data collection and analysis tools on a shared, open source platform that 
uses big data techniques to transform clickstream data from game and design systems into 
formative feedback for usability testing and evidence of learning.

ADAGE is being developed at the [Game + Learning + Society Center](http://www.gameslearningsociety.org) at the University of Wiscsonsin - Madison with
a partnership with [The Learning Games Network](http://www.learninggamesnetwork.org) and the [Wisconsin Institutes of Discovery](http://wid.wisc.edu)
